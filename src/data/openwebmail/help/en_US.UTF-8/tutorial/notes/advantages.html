            <p>Open Webmail is a full-featured webmail, addressbook, calendar and
webdisk system that is designed to manage very large mail folder files
in a quick and memory efficient way. It
has been in development since 2001 and has accumulated a
large number of other very useful features. It also provides many
features to help you to switch from Microsoft Outlook smoothly.
In-depth descriptions of the
various features are available in the sections below.<br>
&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Complete Addressbook</span><br>
            </p>
            <p>The
            <a href="../address_book/editing.html">addressbook</a> is completely compliant
with the vCard contact technology standard. This brings Open Webmail up
to date with current contact exchange technology and allows the sharing
of addressbook information with users of many other popular information
systems such as Evolution, Outlook and others.<br>

      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Calendar with Reminder/Notification Support</span></p>
            <p>You can keep track of appointments, meetings, birthdays, whatever,
with the build-in <a href="../calendar/viewing.html">calendar</a> in Open Webmail. This calendar provides
several views, including year view, month view, week view and day view,
so you can browse scheduled events very easily. There is
also reminder support for scheduled events. You can specify the
days that the reminder should look ahead. For convenience, the first 5
upcoming events are displayed at the top of mail folder view during
normal webmail use. If you want the event reminder to be
available outside the webmail system, you can also specify a
notification email address such as a mobile phone or other mobile
device.
      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Webdisk Support</span><br>
            </p>
            <p>The webdisk module
provides a web interface for access your home directory as a
virtual disk on the web. It is also designed to easily store mail
attachments, allowing you to freely copy attachments between mail
messages and the webdisk.</p>
            <p>The top directory of the virtual
disk is mapped to your home directory and any item displayed in
the virtual disk is actually located under your home directory.</p>
            <p>The
webdisk supports basic common file operations, eg: mkdir, rmdir, copy,
move, rm, chmod, file upload and download. To facilitate the easy
download of multiple files or directories, the webdisk compresses the
files into a zip stream on-the-fly during transmission. It also handles
many types of archives, including zip, arj, rar, tar.gz, tar.bz,
tar.bz2, tgz, tbz, gz, Z and arc. You can compress, decompress or list
the contents of archives on the server without downloading them
to your local computer. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Mail Filter Support</span></p>
            <p>Multiple<a href="../messages/filter.html">
filter rules</a> can be set to move or copy incoming mails to different
folders automatically or even delete them directly. You can
categorize mails from a specific person or spammer and identify mails
containing viruses very easily by defining rules of sender, receiver,
SMTP relay, subject, body or filename of attachments.</p>
            <p>In
addition to the static filter rules, Open Webmail has build-in five
smart filters: repeatness filter, bad format from filter, faked smtp
filter, faked from filter and faked exe content type filter. Repeatness
filter, bad format from filter and faked SMTP filter are useful in
filtering messages from spammers that frequently exhibit these
detectable characteristics. The faked from filter and faked exe
content type filter are useful in filtering messages that may contain
viruses. Since mail filtering is activated only in
Open Webmail, messages will stay in the INBOX until you read your
mail with Open Webmail. <small><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
Note: Other utilities to check mail status may report
new mail incorrectly, since they are not aware of the OpenWebMail
filters. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></p>
            <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
AntiSpam Support through SpamAssassin</span></p>
            <p>Open Webmail can use the popular anti-spam <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> software
to scan messages fetched from pop3 servers or optionally all
incoming messages. The SpamAssassin software will determine a spamlevel
for each scanned message based on its content and assign the message a
spamlevel number. You can define a spamlevel threshold for all your
messages in Open Webmail. Any message with a spamlevel more than this
threshold will be moved from the INBOX to the SPAM folder automatically.</p>
            <p>Open Webmail
also supports Spam/NotSpam bayesian learning technology through the
sa-learn program in SpamAssassin. In case the spamlevel determined by
SpamAssassin is not appropriate, the user can train the system by
telling it to learn the messages as Spam or NotSpam.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
AntiVirus Support through ClamAV</span></p>
            <p>Open Webmail can use the popular anti-virus <a href="http://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a>
software as the external viruscheck module to scan messages fetched
from pop3 servers or optionally all incoming messages. If a message or
its attachments are found to have a virus, Open Webmail will move the
message from the INBOX to the VIRUS folder automatically.</p>
            <p>
      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Spelling Check Support</span></p>
            <p>The<a href="../messages/spellcheck.html">
spelling check</a> in Open Webmail is very user-friendly and powerful: It
makes suggestions for misspelled words and you can correct the
errors very easily by selecting one of the suggestions from a drop-down
menu.<br>
            <br>
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
      

      POP3 Support</p>
            <p>Multiple POP3 accounts
can be defined, allowing you to fetch mails from a number of
mail servers. All messages fetched will be stored in the INBOX folder.
Should the fetch operation exceed 10 seconds (due to a slow link or
large message for example), the operation will be put into background
to avoid an http timeout.</p>
            <p>
      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Auto Login</span></p>
            <p>You can determine if you want to enable the auto login feature in
Open Webmail. When enabled, you don't have to type your username
and password every time to login to Open Webmail. Open Webmail will do
this automatically for you. However, for security reasons, the auto
login feature will be actived only if you don't log out in the
previous session and the previous session has not timed out. Further
more, the system administrator can limit the range of IPs that are
allowed to use the auto login feature.
      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Languages/Multiple Charsets</span></p>
            <p>Open Webmail
is currently available for more than 30 languages and it is quite easy
to add new languages to Open Webmail if yours is still not supported.
For languages with more than one charset, Open Webmail will choose one
as the default charset for the language. If a message is written with a
charset other than the default, it will be converted to the default
charset automatically.<br>

      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Strong MIME Message Capability</span></p>
            <p>Open Webmail
has very strong support for MIME messages. While most webmail packages
present MIME messages poorly compared to traditional POP clients,
Open Webmail presents MIME messages in an attractive format comparable
to that presented by Microsoft Outlook. Either inline or uuencoded
attachments are supported.</p>
            <p>In addition to the presention,
Open Webmail also allow users to <a href="../messages/compose.html">compose</a> complex HTML messages with
inline attachments or external attachments. The friendly WYSIWYG editor <a href="http://trac.xinha.org/" target="_blank">Xinha</a>
has been built into Open Webmail so that you can write HTML messages<br>
conformtably and easily without any knowledge of HTML tags.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Full Content Search</span><br>
            </p>
            <p>Full
content <a href="../toolbars/search.html">search</a> with regular expression support is provided. When you
enter a keyword in the search box, the scope of the mail folder is
limited to the keyword related messages. This means you can use
the sort or static functions on the search result. The scope limit is
released when you select another folder or refreshes the current
folder.
      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Draft Folder Support</span></p>
            <p>This feature
enables you to write a message in a number of stages, even over
several days. You can save an unfinished message into the draft
folder and continue editing at any time.<br>

      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Confirm Reading Support</span></p>
            <p>You can request a 'confirm-reading receipt' for each message sent.
When the message is read by the recipient, a receipt will be sent back
to you.
      

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">HTTP Compression</span></p>
            <p>Open Webmail
supports compression of HTML content over HTTP. With compression turned
on, the average page size is reduced by over 80%. This feature
effectively reduces the use of network bandwidth between the client
computer and the webmail server and is very useful for users with a
slow connection to the webmail server, such as dialup or mobile device
users.</p>
            <p><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use of offline e-mail clients</span></p>



Open Webmail has several abilities and advantages that allow for
excellent flexibility and synchronization with your offline e-mail
client(s).
<p><i>E-mail that has been viewed in your Open Webmail inbox...</i></p>

<ul>
<li>Will be downloaded onto your offline e-mail client and marked as <b>read</b>.
</li><li>Can still be marked as <b>unread</b> if changed so within Open Webmail</li>
</ul>

<p><i>E-mail that has been downloaded onto your offline e-mail client...</i></p>

            <ul>

<li>Will be taken off of the server for viewing on your computer when using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol" target="_blank">POP3</a> protocol on the offline client and will<span style="font-weight: bold;"> not</span> be available for viewing in your Open Webmail inbox.
</li><li>Will <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> be taken off of the server for viewing on your computer when using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol" target="_blank">IMAP</a> protocol and thus will be available for viewing in your Open Webmail inbox.</li>
            </ul>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
            </span>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Easy navigating </span></p>
            <p>Open Webmail also boasts an easy-to-use, compact and
relatively quick navigational system. You can navigate through all the
folders by opening the top left-hand drop menu and selecting the folder
you wish to navigate to. It also doubles as displaying the current
folder.</p>
