= RELEASE NOTES =
=================

MindTerm, release 1.2.1 - Aug 1, 2000
    o Fixed bug when file access not permitted or no home-directory exists
      autosave/load should be disabled (causing totally confusing "Connection
      refused" due to attempt to connect to localhost).
    o Fixed bug when no autoload of settings the username/password was stuck (if
      not changed in dialog)
    o Fixed bug that made AWT load (native libs) regardless of running as a dumb
      terminal
    o Fixed bug with "Save Passwords" (several oddities)
    o Fixed bug in "Clone Terminal" (broken!)
    o Fixed bug in "Save Settings As" (broken!) (thanks to Paul Rouse
      <par@netcraft.com> and Cesar Mendoza <mendoza@kitiara.org> for fix)
    o Changed behaviour for remembering password, now only when using "Save
      Passwords" option

MindTerm, release 1.2 (finally) - Apr 7, 2000
    o Added authentication type 'sdi-token' which can be used with the patch
      from Jean Chouanard <chouanar@parc.xerox.com> (patch found at:
      ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/jean/sshsdi/)
    o Added ability to redirect browser frame/page or launch given external
      (native) program when connection is established with tunneling only client
      (I know this might easily be added to MindTerm too, for now it's not)
    o Added ability to include logo in tunneling only client
    o Added function keys > F12 (i.e. shift/ctrl/shift+ctrl) to terminal for
      types xterm/linux/aixterm. This code will be cleaned out later on to do
      better key-remap support (thanks to Eddy Lai <eddylai@i.am>)
    o Changed SOCKS5 proxy type into socks5-proxy-dns and socks5-local-dns to
      enable connection through a SOCKS5 proxy which don't do name lookups
      (i.e. do the lookup locally or give ip-address instead of hostname)
    o Changed window title to be more concise (thanks to Sean Boran
      sean.boran@swisscom.com for suggestion)
    o Fixed bug with file-transfer when quiet mode was disabled caused funny
      behaviour (end result file-transfer didn't work)
    o Fixed bug in listener and controller which could cause sockets listened on
      not to be closed properly (in local port forwards)
    o Fixed bug in terminal, khome/kend in xterm was wrong (previously took them
      from termcap, now follows terminfo which seems more consistent)
    o Fixed bug in terminal, insert-key was lost somewhere (also, VK_NUMPAD0
      shouldn't be mapped to insert in the first place, besides
      causing a bug :-)
    o Fixed bug in terminal, ctrl-keys ctrl+^, ctrl+_, et.c. didn't work,
      though this still has problems will be fixed fully later, seems to work on
      Linux at least (thanks to Robert Simms <rsimms@math.clemson.edu> for
      pointing this out)
    o Fixed bug passwords cleared while connected (when saving settings) causing
      clone and SCP not to work (thanks to Robert Simms)
    o Fixed bug, shouldn't try to auto-save if connection could not be
      established
    o Fixed bug with file password for settings, password automatically empty
      if enabling save passwords after connected
    o Fixed bug with xterm-color, got wrong identity (should have xterm), made
      among other things arrow-keys give exception (thanks to Robert Simms)
    o Fixed bug with authenticating web-proxy, wrong password didn't give chance
      to correct on retried connect
    o Fixed bug in web-proxy connect, stopped working in 1.2pre4
    o Fixed bug with SCP, shouldn't start tunnels
    o Fixed bug in SSHPropertyHandler signed for Netscape, didn't enable
      fileaccess when checking for preexisting settings file (causing security
      exception)
    o Fixed bug with tunneling client, forgot to enable net-access in
      main-thread (having effect that one could only connect back to same host)
    o Fixed bug with property server not set when not using autoload of settings
    o Fixed bug with hollow cursor leaving trail
    o Fixed bug with command shell, (ugly copy/paste bug)
    o Fixed bug when configuring SOCKS4 proxy in dialog, a username should be
      given (before username could only be given at prompt when connecting)
    o Fixed bug with tunneling only client, cancel login gave exception
    o Fixed bug with find dialog, find on empty string caused exception
    o Fixed bug with scp dialog, WM close button tied to "Change Direction"
    o Fixed bug with tunneling only client, list-mode can only be used if home
      directory containing aliases is given
    o Fixed bug that quiet mode was not default in applet
    o Fixed some minor other bugs in tunneling only client
    o Fixed annoyance, long paths/filenames caused SCP copy progress window to
      be very wide (thanks to Robert Simms for suggestion)
    o Fixed annoyance, long host names caused alias-prompt to wrap (not really
      fixed but shouldn't be a problem now) (thanks to Robert Simms
      for pointing this out)
    o Fixed annoyance, "Address already in use" error message clearer now
      (thanks to sean.boran@swisscom.com for suggestion)
    o Added "convenience" hitting enter in filetransfer progress indicator when
      done removes dialog (i.e. equal to pressing "Done" button)
    o Changed all dialogs to be resizable, not beeing resizable caused strange
      behaviour on e.g. Solaris JDK (thanks to Jade Cravy <jade@gdatech.com>)


=================
MindTerm, release 1.2pre5 - Mar 09, 2000

    o Added mindbright.application.MindTunnelCli which is a client for doing
      tunneling only (check the example html-page or command line --? for now,
      docs will come later on)
    o Added ability to include 'known_hosts' file in jar-file as resource
      (in /defaults/known_hosts.txt), pretty handy for a signed applet (or
      applet served over https)
    o Added "Save Passwords" (i.e. same as --x and 'savepasswords') as menu
      option (menu Settings)
    o Added "Configure Proxy" button to Settings -> SSH Connection dialog (for
      clarity)
    o Changed behaviour to only allow configuring tunnels when connected
    o Fixed bug with file transfer "Pipe Broken" (appeared in 1.2pre4)
    o Fixed bug with file transfer to local file/dir with space(s) in name
      (thanks to Robert Simms <rsimms@math.clemson.edu> for pointing this out)
    o Fixed bug with transfer of file with zero bytes (wasn't fixed before!)


=================
MindTerm, release 1.2pre4 - Mar 02, 2000

    o Separated (and cleaned out) the handling of settings from the interactive
      client (new class SSHPropertyHandler) should now be more intuitive
    o Added ability to have password (all types) as applet parameter (only for
      https of course :-) or property (i.e. given on command-line or
      saved/loaded from settings file), enabled with command-line option --x or
      with applet parameter 'savepasswords' set to 'true' (default is NOT to
      save any passwords)
    o When passwords are saved a password is used to protect the whole settings
      file (much like the protection of the RSA private key). The password can
      be empty (hit enter when prompted to set password).
    o When encrypted settings are loaded (i.e. with saved passwords in them)
      they are automatically decrypted if the password was the same as for the
      last file visited (i.e. if you have the same password on all files OR have
      no password protection on them you will be able to connect to different
      sites without entering anything but the alias, pretty convenient)
    o Changed behaviour to query for name of alias (filename minus extension)
      where to save settings. The name of the file is used as an alias of the
      session with which it can be referred directly at the prompt.
    o Changed behaviour of settings, new (as in no settings previously saved)
      connections don't inherit tunnels from previously open connection
    o Changed behaviour to have option 'quiet' on by default
    o Fixed the sloppy cleanup when server-connection is closed down (release of
      sockets et.c.)
    o Fixed bug accepted X11-forward eventhough didn't request it(!)
    o Fixed bug with Caps and Shift on jdk1.2 (rather a workaround for bug in
      jdk1.2)
    o Fixed bug in TerminalWin key-handler, some things had broken with new code
    o Fixed subtle bug in TerminalWin.update where character-position not drawn
      but contained attributes
    o Fixed some minor bugs (can't remember...)


=================
MindTerm, release 1.2pre3 - Feb 12, 2000

    o Added terminal type aixterm (does it work?)
    o Added terminal sequences ECH, CHT, SU, SD, CBT
    o Added keys shift+page-up/dn => scroll in savelines buffer
    o Added insert-key to send proper esc. (e.g. in xterm <ESC>[2~)
    o Fixed bug with linedraw mode in terminal (only worked with SI/SO)
    o Fixed bug with inverse attribute along with fg/bg colors (showed with
      mutt) (thanks to Roy-Magne Mo <romo@interpost.no> for pointing
      this out)
    o Fixed bug with ED/EL/DCH/DL/ICH/IL didn't fill in fg/bg
      colors (e.g. some also showed in mutt)
    o Fixed bug with DEC-SC/RC in terminal (didn't save gsets/curgl)
    o Fixed bug with CPL/CNL in terminal (didn't do CR)
    o Fixed bug with tabstops in terminal (didn't stop before window-edge)
    o Fixed bug in scp file transfer where local directory was given with
      ending directory separator (didn't work in Mac and win32)
    o Fixed colors in terminal (before intensity-on didn't change color :-)
    o Fixed bug with jview v4.79.0.2424 ("BorderLayout: ... null" resulting in
      tiny unusable window)

    The following is thanks to Nicholas Riley <njriley@uiuc.edu>
    --
    (Nicholas has done some more Mac-specific changes which are not included right now
    but will be in a later release)
    o Added close-listeners on window-close icon in all Dialogs
    o Added return/escape keys to act as Ok and Cancel in some dialogs
    o Added simple color-preview in terminal-settings
    o Fixed KeyEvent handling in terminal, now uses keyPressed (^H ^M now works ok)
    o Fixed home-directory ending with File.separator don't work with mkdir on Mac
    o Fixed wordings in the RSA keygeneration dialog
    o Fixed wordings in the SCP file transfer dialog
    o Fixed scrollbar to prevent double border on the Mac
    o Changed background of TextFields/Lists to System.text (better on Mac)
    o Fixed resizing of some dialogs


=================
MindTerm, release 1.2pre2 - Jan 30, 2000

    o Added support for SOCKS v4 and v5 (v5 supports only non-auth and cleartext
      username/password)
    o Removed ability to save proxy-password in config, will be added again along
      with rewrite of property-handling
    o Changed behaviour of http-proxy, listens for authenticating proxy's
      challenge (i.e. can't decide if proxy wants authentication in advance since
      when 'Digest' mode is used the challenge MUST be read first)
    o Fixed bug tried to do lookup on ssh-server eventhough behind web-proxy
    o Fixed bug in proxy-dialog
    o Fixed bug in SCP, didn't work with openSSH, hard-coded name of binary
      was scp1 (thanks to Dale Anson <danson@aa.net> for pointing this out)
    o Fixed bug clipboard not shared between instances when system-clipboard
      unavailable
    o Added DEC_ID (<ESC>Z) query in terminal (e.g. used by qterm)


=================
MindTerm, (internal) release 1.2pre1 - Jan 17, 2000
    o Added ability to connect through a web-proxy-tunnel (e.g. squid and FWTK's
      http-gw)
      six new properties are used for this (proxyhost, proxyport,
      proxyuser, proxypasswd, proxyproto, proxysavepwd) see README for details.
      Properties can also be set in Proxy-dialog ("Settings" -> "Proxy...")
      (thanks to John Pallister <john@synchromesh.com> and
      Jim McGrath <jim@synchromesh.com>)


=================
MindTerm, release 1.1.5 - Dec 19, 1999

    o Fixed bug with signed applet (Netscape), could not use SCP to other site
      than originator (forgot to request permissions in copy thread)
      (thanks to Atro.Tossavainen@helsinki.fi for pointing this out)
    o Fixed bug div/zero in SCP when sending file with 0 bytes
      (thanks to David Brinegar <davidb@lmi.net> for pointing this out)
    o Fixed bug when trying to copy (ctrl+INS) when no selection, a null crashed
      jdk1.2.2 on win32! (thanks to Kurt Werle <Kurt.Werle@pobox.com>
      for pointing this out)
    o Fixed bug when changing fg/bg-color screen not updated correctly
    o Fixed bug causing end-less update-loop in pathological case trying
      to redraw partially hidden cursor (showed as flickering hung terminal).
    o Changed so that generated RSA-key does not have to contain a comment


=================
MindTerm, (internal) release 1.1.4 - Dec 12, 1999

    o Minor changes


=================
MindTerm, release 1.1.3 - Nov 26, 1999

    o Fixed bug with server-key beeing longer than host-key (why would one want
      that?)
    o Fixed bug with scp-filedialog when file chosen contained spaces
    o Now using JAX (from IBM alphaworks) for slimming down binaries. Now also
      have a separate terminal-only client (100k in size).


=================
MindTerm, release 1.1.2 - Oct 31, 1999

    o Fixed bug with not handling Graphics.getClipBounds sometims returning NULL
      (thanks to Shane Hathaway <hathawsh@slcc.edu> for report+fix)
    o Fixed some minor things in MindTunnel (ssh server)


=================
MindTerm, release 1.1.1 (codename seven...) - Oct 27, 1999

    o Now the screen-update is flicker- AND bug-free :-)
    o Oh, on popular demand I also added a main-class manifest-entry :-)
      (file mainclass.mf)


=================
MindTerm, release 1.1 - Oct 25, 1999

    o Added built in SCP file-transfer, can also be used from command-line.
      (menu: "File" -> "SCP File Transfer...", see README 4.1.9 and 6.2)
    o Added IDEA cipher for completeness and also because it's compact (note
      that IDEA may be subject to licensing for commercial use)
    o Added applet-parameter 'appletbg' to set background of Applet's Panel
      syntax is same as params 'bg', 'fg', 'cc' (suggested by Michael Ransburg
      <daneel@tux.org>)
    o Changed behaviour, reverse-video (DECSCNM) is now like in xterm
    o Changed behaviour, cursor is hollow when lost focus, just like yer olde
      xterm :-) (suggested by Dale Anson <danson@aa.net>)
    o Fixed bug total braindamage in TerminalWin.update(), double
      buffering effect was somewhat canceled with a line left from
      "pre-double-buffering" code!?! Now flicker is non-existent :-)
    o Fixed bug printed ^@ (nul) in vt220 (et.al) instead of ignoring it (when
      used for padding)
    o Fixed bug tried to show cursor when at end-of-line
    o Fixed bug background color of combo-boxes in terminal-menus were wrong
    o Fixed bug with tab in terminal (thanks to Eric Youngblut
      <yngblut@cs.washington.edu>)


=================
MindTerm, release 1.0.1 - Sep 26, 1999

    o Added requestFocus when window changes size (lost focus before when
      resized)
    o Added set/clear tabs in terminal (<ESC>H HTS and <ESC>[g TBC)
    o Now checks for availability of Monospaced font (seems that MicroLost
      hasn't got it sometimes...), now choose Monospaced and fallback to Courier
      or DialogInput if not found
    o Fixed bug with cursor-index (<ESC>D) when used for scrolling area, did not
      scroll, e.g. pine linked with termlib2.1 on FreeBSD, though pico linked
      with termcap2.1 did not show bug since it did not use cursor-index to
      scroll. (thanks to Stefan Powell <spowell@moi.org> for pointing this out
      AND letting me test it on his system)
    o Fixed bug when connection lost (e.g. timed out by NAT or server killed)
      made MindTerm hang since keyboard input was never restored to "local"
      mode. (causing NULLPointerException when key pressed after disconnect)
      (thanks to Barry W Anderson <bwa@shori.com> for pointing this out)
    o Fixed bug now clears title-string when disconnected (if set with
      XTERM-Change title)
    o Fixed bug when set local-host ('localhst'), address did not show in
      settings-dialog after settings loaded (thanks to Sebastian Åkerman
      <sak@parallelconsulting.com> for pointing this out)
    o Fixed bug when window resized and cursor was drawn so cursor was not
      visible, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown in update


=================
MindTerm, release 1.0 (codename anniversary) - Sep 14, 1999

    o Changed behaviour when connecting to known (settings-file exists) host,
      quiet mode is always selected if used option --q or in applet quiet=true
    o Fixed bug when "Save as..." could not have other name on file
      than host(!), also did not save if properties hadn't changed(!)
    o Fixed bug with autosave, didn't save when it should(!)
    o Fixed bug created settings-file eventhough unknown-host
    o Shaped up documentation a bit, needs more work still though
    o Made a small tested-platforms list (file PLATFORMS), please report
      success/failure so I can confirm/extend it


=================
MindTerm, (minor) release 0.99-3 - Sep 10, 1999

    o Fixed (finally!) the initial geometry problems, componetResized and
      friends in TerminalWin is cleaned out a bit more. It seems that there is
      no other way than to force the size with setSize of the Canvas, otherwise
      it will get componentResized calls where getSize reports component has
      shrunk/grown etc. when Menubar is added (behaving different on each
      platform/jvm/version of course...).
    o Fixed bug, mistakenly the click for focus was on button3... (copy/paste
      programming, what can I say...)
    o Fixed bug, when opening clone-windows in applet, when closing last window
      tried to do System.exit()
    o Changed (silly) default value of keep-alive in settings dialog to 10 seconds


=================
MindTerm, (minor) release 0.99-2 - Sep 06, 1999

    o Added parameter 'localhost' to set address to bind to for local tunnels
      (if not explicitly given), default value is 0.0.0.0 (i.e. all local
      addresses)
    o Added ability to give localhost as described above per tunnel when using
      parameter 'localN' or when set with dialog "Advanced Tunnels Setup"
      (e.g. /ftp/127.0.0.1:4711:foobar:21 gives a tunnel listening ONLY on
      127.0.0.1)
    o Changed behaviour when using "SSH Connection..." in menu "Settings"
      now always acts as "New Server" when not connected.
    o Changed layout of "SSH Settings"/"New Server" dialog for easier use
    o Fixed stupid behaviour in componentResized, got called several times with
      same size when realizing window, generating lot's of (unnecessary)
      garbage/work
    o Fixed oddity, when connected but not logged in could not disconnect
    o Fixed bug exception in componentResized in some versions of jview and
      when running in hotjava/jdk1.2-plugin in separate frame
    o Fixed bug in SSH Settings Dialog, field 'Server' incorrectly disabled
      if "New Server" was used twice
    o Fixed bug in "Advanced Tunnels Setup" dialog, invalid string-descriptions
    o Fixed (old) bug with space-key lock with popup menus (seems that we don't
      get a focusLost eventhough the keyReleased does not get sent to us, thus
      we can't rely on focusLost entirely it seems?!?)
    o Fixed double-click-select time now raised, seems smoother
    o Added string "(CLONE)" to end of title-bar of cloned windows (to identify
      the clones which can be closed without losing the ssh-connection in the
      original window that contains the tunnels)


=================
MindTerm, (minor) release 0.99-1 - Aug 29, 1999

    o Fixed subtle bug in terminal when scrolling an area (defined with DECSTBM)
      smaller than screen but starting at top. (e.g. showed in VI using termcap
      when deleting a line when status-line show, having effect that status-line
      scrolled up)
    o Fixed ansi-colors again! (was still broken, I admit it, I "forgot" to test
      it, I was so sure I got it right but copy/paste can be so hazardous
      sometimes... :-) (thanks to Bernhard Reiter <bernhard@uwm.edu> for
      pointing this out)
    o Added option 'cc' to terminal to set colour of cursor, default in xterm
      is blue so now our cursor is too :-) (thanks to Jeff Foster
      <jfoste@woodward.com>)


=================
MindTerm, release 0.99 - Aug 24, 1999

    o Now supports a comma-separated list of auth-types to try, in order as
      given, (suggested by Brian Wellington <bwelling@tislabs.com>)
    o Fixed the broken ansi-colours (broke in the TerminalWin "clean-up" in
      0.99pre3...), also small fixed small odditiy when typing colored text
    o Fixed oddities when doing "File -> Clone Terminal" (e.g. should not open
      tunnels, nor load settings)
    o Authtype 'rhosts' added, was not implemented (do anybody use it?)
    o Added confirmation-dialog if exiting while connected (Do we need it?
      I don't see one in xterm... :-)
    o Added dialog showing that a tunnel was successfully opened when adding
      tunnels while connected.
    o Ctrl-characters now printed if not interpreted (e.g. '^@' for NUL, '^A'
      for SOH etc.)
    o Changed behaviour of setting of window-mgr cursor; when terminal has focus
      a text-cursor is set, otherwise system-default (e.g. arrow) cursor is set.
    o Fixed oddity with jdk1.2/hotjava, having effect; change of
      terminal-settings automatically gave font Dialog, cause default font was
      Courier, changed to Monospaced instead (Courier is not in the default
      set of fonts in java2)
    o Fixed kludge in TerminalWin that caused unnecessary flicker in some updates
    o Fixed jdk1.2 initial terminal-size bug (note, this is a fix, not a
      "solution" :-)
    o Fixed bug with space-key, sometimes "hangs", it was the ctrl-key-kludge
      that was broken...
    o Fixed bug with java-plugin2/hotjava never got focus when 'sepframe'=false
    o Compiled a (limited) FAQ
    o Update of README started, will be useful in 1.0 :-)


=================
MindTerm, more-shape-up release 0.99pre3 (codename premania...) - Aug 17, 1999

    o  Now supports netscape-code-signing (SSH.NETSCAPE_SECURITY_MODEL = true, else include
       mindbright/dummies/ in classpath just to keep compiler happy)
    o  Fixed stupidity in TerminalWin that gave bad performance and ate unnecessary memory
    o  Scrolling large portions of text (e.g. long ls) was a pain in win32 (and others?) (due
       to "thread-scheduler-lag" it was not seen on all platforms), fix makes it more endurable now
       (real problem is of course that screen-update of TerminalWin is a bit slow :-)
    o  Added some menu shortcuts, maybe not very intuitive but it's not very flexible in java
    o  Changed order of OK/Cancel buttons in dialogs (I'm no GUI-guru obviously...)
    o  Changed behaviour, when server-key not added to 'known_hosts' it still connects though
       it notifies the user that "server verification" is turned off in this session
    o  Added option 'forcpty' (allocate a PTY) to the SSH Settings Dialog
    o  TerminalWin eats less memory now but if outofmemory should occur when setting size
       of scroll-back buffer it is reported
    o  When home-directory/known_hosts-file not found, now dialog-box asks if it should be
       created if we are running with a GUI
    o  Fixed colour of border of window to be same as terminal
    o  Default directory changed to $HOME/mindterm (confusing in winDOS with .ssh)
    o  Added label with MindTerm home-directory in 'Connect...' dialog
    o  File.isDirectory in Netscape seems broken?! removed it, no big deal...
    o  Added option --D (applet 'debug') to dump some debug-info if needed
    o  Now sets window-mgr cursor to text-cursor when above TerminalWin component
    o  Fixed intermittent bug when exit in Netscape, resize would be sent after disconnect
    o  Fixed bug with jdk1.2, background color of widgets in dialogs
    o  Fixed bug, if a cipher-class-file was missing, gave "Error connecting to .. reason: -> null"
       (thanks to Frank Behrens <frank@pinky.sax.de>)
    o  Other small fixes/cleanup


=================
MindTerm, shape-up release 0.99pre2 (codename Eclipse :-) - Aug 11, 1999

    o  Applet now supports running a single command (parameter 'commandline')
       (NOTE: if 'forcpty' is not 'true', a dumb terminal is used)
    o  Fixed ftp PORT-command proxying to be more useful (can't be better without making more connections)
       (NOTE: if the sshd is "behind" a NAT/FW parameter 'realsrv' must be set to sshd's real ip-address)
    o  Added notification when trying to use ftp PORT-commands on a ftp-tunnel,
       when PORT-proxying is not enabled for easier diagnostics/usage
    o  Last shape-up of menus/dialogs before 0.99
    o  Ok, now popup-menu mouse-button can be set, --m or (applet parameter 'menus') is as before
       but can also be "pop1", "pop2", "pop3" for mouse buttons 1,2,3 respectively
    o  Alert dialogs appears when "fatal" errors occurs here and there
    o  When creating RSA-identity, public key is also stored on clipboard for convenience
    o  Fixed bugs in Tunnel-dialogs (they were a mess...)
    o  Fixed some other minor bugs introduced with 0.99pre1 (rather hasty release :-)

MindTerm, release 0.99pre1 - Jul 30, 1999

    o  Removed package applet, confusing, now applet and application are the same
       (in class mindbright.application.MindTerm)
    o  Changed handling of properties some, properties can be automatically saved and/or loaded
       option --p <none|both|save|load> (applet parameter 'autoprops') sets these flags.
    o  Added option --f <file> (applet parameter 'propsfile') to directly load settings from file
    o  Added a menubar with pulldown-menus (menus have been rearranged and (hopefully :-) improved)
    o  Now supports simple RSA-key-generation from dialog ('create..' in file menu)
    o  Now supports multiple open terminals ('clone...' or 'new..' in file menu)
    o  Now supports capture/send output/input to/from file ('capture...' and 'send...' in file menu)
    o  Now supports searching in scrollback-buffer ('find...' in edit menu)
    o  Now supports click-selection (i.e. double-click = select 'word' and tripple-click =
       select line, option 'sd' sets string of word-delimeter characters, default is only space)
    o  Added option 'alive' to set an interval in seconds at which to send MSG_IGNORE packets
       to keep the ssh-connection up if it is subject to timeouts (e.g. timeouting NAT/FW or proxy)
    o  Added option 'cs' which indicates whether to do copy on select or not (ctrl+insert = copy)
    o  Added option 'de' to set if delete-key sends <BS> or <DEL>
    o  Added option --m ('menus' in applet) values can be 'pop' for popup-menu or 'no' for no menus
    o  Fixed SSHPduQueue to be flow-controlled (fixed starvation problems)
    o  Some minor performance tweaks, for example:
       +  SSHPduQueue is now its own fast FIFO instead of using Vector
       +  All Cipher's now by default writes back to same buffer (3des was memory-intensive :-)
       +  SSHPduOutputStream.writeTo was a very lazy (stupid :-) implementation, better now
       +  Relaxed entropy of random pad-bytes some, now a low pri thread "stirs" them every 10 secs
    o  Applet requests focus when started (the reason for this not beeing there before was that I
       assumed it was something more browserspecific so I didn't test it :-)
    o  Fixed bug SSHSocketTunnel stupid synchronization could cause dead-locks
    o  Fixed bug SSHSocket et.al could not be used in (unprivileged) applets
    o  Fixed bug SSHSocket when 'MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILURE' locked caller of connect
    o  Added package mindbright.vnc which is an ssh-enabled and somewhat modified version of
       the java-version of VNC from 'http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/'


=================
MindTerm, (minor) release 0.98-4 - Jul 12, 1999

    o  Added option --q ('quiet' in applet), don't prompt for server/username if given
       (note: in applet, servername is always considered given)
    o  Local clip-board added when not able to use system-clipboard (unpriv. applet)
    o  Shift+insert => paste (as before: mouse2 => paste), silly could not paste
       in winDOS or other non-3-button-mouse-environments :-)
    o  Size and position of terminal can be set in property 'gm', which is an x-geometry string
       (only size is stored when changed dynamically, not position)
    o  DEC 80/132 column switching implemented
    o  Added TIS authentication-server support (by Rich Johnson, rjohnson@ncar.UCAR.EDU)
    o  Ability to enable local command-shell with option --c ('cmdsh' applet), default is disabled.
    o  Split SSHStdIO into SSHStdio and SSHCommandShell (can save space if not used)
    o  Visual bell automatically enabled if not authorized to do toolkit.beep() (as in IE4)
    o  MindTerm homedir settable in applet with 'sshhome' (same as option --h)
    o  Fixed bug with keyrepeat (cursor-keys etc. did not repeat)
    o  Fixed bug lost focus when minimized in Win32
    o  Fixed bug tunnel dies "Open failure on nonexistent channel: 0"
       (silly bug, MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILURE was never handled correctly!)
    o  Fixed bug when fg-color-esc used (made selection hide text if fg-color set was same
       as original fg-color)
    o  Fixed bug option --d (stopped working some time back, didn't test it sorry)
    o  Fixed bug in SSHFtpPlugin when doing PORT (the random ports could wrap :-)
    o  Fixed bug 'verbose' in applet (had forgotten to use it eventhough it was there... :-)
    o  Fixed cast bug in MindTerm.java (in applet, now does getParent until find a Frame)
    o  Separate frame in applet tested, works (again?), was it really broken at some stage?


=================
MindTerm, (minor) release 0.98-3 - Feb 23, 1999

    o  Ansi IRM (insert mode) in terminal (param 'im')
    o  Lots of new terminal esc-seq. are recognized (some are still unimplemented though)
    o  terminal 'linux' now works ok(?) (as a result from above :-)
    o  Fixed so that the MindTerm homedir is (optionally) created if it does not exist
    o  SSHPduQueue final
    o  Updated the README to be a bit more helpful...
    o  Visual bell implemented (param 'vb')


=================
MindTerm, release 0.98 - Feb 1, 1999

    o  DEC-REVWR (reverse wrap-around)
    o  LNM (auto-linefeed)
    o  mouse1 + mouse2 for copy/paste (instead of INS-key paste)
    o  allow localhost only, to tunnels (param 'remfwd')
    o  'known_hosts' file used as with standard (unix) ssh client (can
       be turned off with 'idhost')
    o  ctrl+mouse3 in TerminalWin => pop-up menu with terminal-options
       plus "insertable" other options
    o  Options to set background/foreground colors (not only rev.vid.)
       (xiterm-sequence is recognized but not implemented)
    o  Xterm-sequences for setting the terminal title and iconname
       (xterm-sequences are recognized, no distinction made for title/iconname)
    o  Added option to let backspace send <BS> or <DEL> (param 'bs')
    o  Params 'local0', 'local1', ..., 'localN' and 'remote0', ..., 'remoteN' =>
       properties/applet-parms for tunnels.
    o  All parameters settable in applet (e.g. terminal type 'te')
    o  ditto with stand-alone version
    o  Save/load all settings in property-files
    o  FTP PORT, disabled by default (i.e. no remote-forwards allocated by default)
    o  seed-generation was quite slow, now parmeter 'secrand' gives
       option of relaxing entropy in initial seed
    o  Removed file terminal/TerminalKeyModMap.java from cvs-repository
    o  Fixed bug: deleteChars array-index-out-of-bounds (bug in TerminalXTerm.java DCH)
    o  Fixed bug: interpretChar array-index-out-of-bounds (e.g. polish characters (iso-8859-2))
    o  Fixed bug: deleteLines (e.g. emacs scroll forward half-page when moving off bottom)
    o  Fixed bug: BS was flaky
    o  Fixed bug: applet stealing focus


=================
MindTerm, release 0.97 - Jan 10, 1999

New in this release (applet now more usable otherwise mainly terminal-enhancemnents):
    o  New copyright-policy (again :-). Now the code is GPL.
    o  Now uses random generator and MD5 hash from Logi Ragnarsson's (GPL'd) cryptonite
       (<http://www.hi.is/~logir/cryptonite/>, it's excelent check it out!) which
       makes the applet runnable from 'most' (at last :-) browsers
       (e.g. <many-OS's>/Netscape4.x, <many-OS's>/java-plugin, win32/IE4)
    o  Added support for selecting terminal-emulation (with 'set term
       <term-type>' in local command-shell, NOTE: the TERM env. variable is only
       set at initial login)
    o  Added several terminal-types (xterm-color/xterm/linux/scoansi etc.), only
       xterm/xterm-color tested more thoroughly, the rest is tested very briefly
    o  Colors work (in terminals supporting colors)
    o  Line-draw characters work (in terminals supporting it)
    o  Mouse works (only xterm/xterm-color)
    o  Function keys now work, sending respective terminal's esc-seq.
    o  PgUP, PgDN, Home and End keys can be used either "locally" for controlling the
       scroll-back buffer OR they can be set to send proper escape-sequences
       (use 'set lp <true|false>' in local command-shell)
    o  Fixed bug: Keyboard focus is lost when iconified in WinDOS (95/98/NT)
       (NOTE: this bugfix is quite strange, I don't understand this fully)
    o  Fixed bug: Keyboard focus never acquired when run as applet with plugin when
       NOT run in a separate frame


=================
MindTerm, release 0.96 - Nov 29, 1998

New in this release (mainly for java-developers):
    o  Exit to command-shell without disconnecting (finally :-)
    o  Dynamic handling of port-forwards from the command-shell, local ports
       can be added/deleted "on the fly" (remote ports can only be deleted).
       ('list', lists open tunnels).
    o  Can now run single command-line without shell.
    o  New interfaces SSHAuthenticator/SSHClientUser/SSHConsole makes
       it very easy to use the SSHClient class separately.
    o  New method in SSHClient (doSingleCommand) to be able to do a
       single command on the sshd-machine.
    o  SSHSocket/SSHServerSocket/SSHSocketFactory for fully transparent
       usage of SSH in an arbitrary application/applet (see sample code for
       usage).
    o  Documentation started (a lot to do here... :-).
    o  Code cleaned out and reorganized a bit (more on the way)


=================
MindTerm, release 0.95 - Nov 13, 1998

New in this release:
    o  RSA/rhosts-RSA authentication method added
    o  DES/3DES and RC4 cryptos added (RC4 is for speed, I know
       it's weak...)
    o  New copyright-policy, now MindTerm is totally FREEWARE, only limitation
       is that you may not derive commercial work from it without our
       written permission
    o  I have given up(*) on the built-in seed-generator of SecureRandom and implemented my own
       (which might be a bit naive but it's random enough for me, improvements are welcome!).
    o  Now "applet-enabled", the class mindbright.applet.MindTerm can be used to run MindTerm
       as an applet(***) (both in a separate Frame or in the Applet-Panel itself)
    o  Fixed some minor stuff also (thanks to among others: <perrot@lal.in2p3.fr>)
    o  Fixed bug in TerminalWin which caused an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException on occasion

(*) There seems to be problems with running the built-in seed-generator of the class
    java.security.SecureRandom. In some situations it never returns and in others it
    seems to take several minutes to complete. I implemented my own seed-generator
    which is in the file mindbright/security/BogusSeed.java, it has quite some
    non-determinism(**) about it, it might not be the most random seed you
    will ever see but it sure is random enough for me... However you can still use
    the built-in seed-generator with command-line option '-r' if it works for you.

(**) It runs for a non-fixed time under which it randomly samples the milliseconds-clock
     (least significant 2 bytes), it also samples free memory (also 2 lsb), and also it
     samples the hashcode (2 lsb) of newly created Objects. The time spent generating the
     seed is dependant on the time spent before connecting, the time for name-lookup on
     the ssh-server, the time of the TCP-connect, and the time for transmission of the
     initial "handshake" (i.e. id-string and SMSG_PUBLIC_KEY).

(***) Currently works only with IE4, Netscape does not ship the whole java.* classes in their
      browsers (at least to my knowledge). It should work with the java-plugin but I have not
      tried this. See <http://www.mindbright.se/sshlogin.html> for example of usage.


=================
MindTerm, release 0.9BETA2 - Oct 08, 1998

New stuff:
    o  X11-forwarding
    o  Selection now works (kludge: use insert-key to paste in wait for menus...)
    o  Now does cursor-keys (with DECCKM toggle)
    o  PgUP and PgDN keys scrolls by a page in save-buffer (if there is one)
    o  Home and End keys scrolls to top and bottom in save-buffer (if there is one)
    o  Bug in win95/nt (could not print tilde, Hazeltine?! :-)
    o  Bug in ftp (only showed with lynx as I know of, since it disconnects)
    o  MTU option
    o  MSG_DEBUG from server is now logged to console (thanks Zhiqiang Shi <zhiqiang@asianet.co.th>=
    o  other minor bug-fixes...


=================
MindTerm, release 0.9BETA - Sep 14, 1998 (first public release)

Features:
    o  Password authentication
    o  Blowfish block-cipher
    o  Standard SSH port-forwarding
    o  Special FTP port-forwarding (see FTP-NOTE below)
    o  Plugin-architecture for adding other (than FTP)
       protocol-specific "proxies"
    o  Full (almost :-) vt100 support (i.e. emacs, pine etc. works :-)
    o  NonGUI mode, i.e. run at command-line without opening a
       terminal-window
    o  The SSH package can be used quite easily by itself to "SSH-enable"
       an arbitrary java-application
    o  The terminal package can (of course) also be used by itself
    o  Cross-platform (it's java :-)
