   (thanks to Alex Teslik, alex.AT.acatysmoof.com for his great implementation)

ps: BETA! NOT PRODUCTION READY!

    The new addressbook code has NOT been tested worldwide. 
    Although every effort has been made to eliminate any possible errors, 
    it is STRONGLY recommended that this code should NOT be run in a 
    production environment until it can be tested by a larger user base.

ps: It is okay to install the new version over the old one.
    but don't forget to remove import.gif, export.gif 
    from data/images/iconsets/*/ (which are not used any more)

ps: If you are upgrading from older openwebmail, don't forget to convert 
    the global addressbook to new vard format by
    
	openwebmail-tool.pl -c

    The user addressbook will be auto converted at the first access.
    However, the sysadm may also choose to convert the addressbook for all 
    users manually by

	openwebmail-tool.pl -c -a

2. Welcome Alex Teslik to the openwebmail develope team :)

4. fix bugs in repeated message filter in mailfilter.pl

   b. old messages may be filtered because the index db recreation would
      make all messages appear as new at once. 
   c. the id of repeated msgs were not logged correctly when 
      log_filtermove_detail is on

ps: the db format is changed slightly in this release,

07/24/2004
----------
1. remove the long lock of folderfile/folderdb in mailfilter.pl
   put the filtering process into background, returns after 10 seconds wait.
   This is very helpful for the following cases
   a. slow systems 
   b. system that enable spamcheck/viruscheck for all messages. 
   c. user that has many messages reserved in INBOX
ps: This background mailfilter is an experimental feature, there could be
    few messages not filtered immediately
2. add option bgfilterwait to user preference so user can control how long
   they would like to wait for background mail filtering before message folder
   list or message content is returned
3. fix the piperead error that happened in adding word to personal dictionary 
   if aspell 0.50 is used.
   (reported by Thomas Chung, tchung.AT.openwebmail.org)


07/22/2004
----------
1. change the default servicename used in auth_pam.pl from 'openwebmail' to
   'login' so sysadm doesn't have to add the openwebmail service name into
   /etc/pam.d/ or /etc/pam.conf before using auth_pam.pl
2. log information of the clienip/language/browser for those who tries to 
   connect vavation.pl as CGI


07/21/2004
----------
1. fix a bug in spamcheck.pl and viruscheck.pl that chmod(0666, filename)
   was typed as chmod(666, filename)

   description of an attachment may be displayed in wrong chrset 
   in case user read message with charset different than the message charset


07/20/2004
----------
1.  hide --LEARNSPAM--, --LEARNHAM-- in destination folders if 
    option enable_learnspam is set to no in openwebmail.conf
    add options has_virusfolder_by_default, has_spamfolder_by_default
    to openwebmail.conf
    (suggested by Oleg D., dzoleg.AT.mail.ru)
2. some changes to the data/openwebmail/download/ directory:
   a. rename openwebmail*.tgz to openwebmail.tar.gz
      as .tar.gz is a more conventional name for source distribution than .tgz
   b. all official released openwebmail are put in downlaod/release/
      so the location of released tar ball won't be changed between releases
   c. daily nsapshot of openwebmail-current.tar.gz are put in download/snapshot/
      so it is easier to trace the changes between releases
   d. the lastest current and the diff between latest current and last release 
      are put in download/current/


07/19/2004
----------
1. fix the compatible issue of spamcheck, viruscheck, learnspam, 
   mstnef for platforms that use bash as default shell

ps:perl process will invoke shell to execute commands in the following cases
   a. open with pipe |
   b. command within ``
   c. command passed to system() or exec() as a whole string
      and the string has shell escape char in it

   When bash is started and parent ruid!=0, 
   it will have ruid=parent ruid, euid=parnet ruid (for security reason, I guess)
   instead of ruid=parnet ruid, euid=parent euid

   So the command executed by shell may have different euid than perl process
   And this is where the compatibility issue comes from.


07/18/2004
----------
1. add support for ms-tnef attachment.
   This requires the tnef program at http://tnef.sourceforge.net/
   (suggested by Dominic Lu, dominic.AT.dominic.idv.tw,

----------
1. fix a security hole that parameters were passed to userstat.pl 
   without shell escape char checking
   (thanks to Ken Girrard, kgirrard.AT.users.sourceforge.net for his fix)

ps: This userstat.pl is not used by openwbemail runtime system, 
    it is designed to query user mail/calendar status for static webpages.
    So if you don't want to upgrade your openwebmail, you may just remove 
    this userstat.pl as a workaround.

2. add md5 support to auth module auth_mysql.pl
   (thanks to Yuan-Chung Hsiao, ychsiao.AT.linux.mis.stu.edu.tw)
