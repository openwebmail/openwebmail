# passwdfile - This is the location of the file containing both usernames and
#              their corresponding encrypted passwords.  If you're using
#              shadowed passwords, change it to /etc/shadow, and if you're

# maxabooksize - This is the maximum size, in kilobytes, that a user's address

#               be immediately deleted, until space is freed.  This does not
#               prevent the operation taking the user over this limit from

# $attlimit - This is the limit on the size of attachments (in MB).  Large

#             size only, and will not prevent users from receiving messages with
#             large attachments.  That's up to you in your sendmail
