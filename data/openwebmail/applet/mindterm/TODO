= Somewhat prioritized lists of problems to solve and things TODO in general =
==============================================================================

LATEST KNOWN BUGS:
    o Bug can't drag-select only one character (one character hilighted but two
      copied, annoying but I'm too lazy right now...)
    o Bug in win32, clipboard seems to stop working sometimes? Seems like when
      it stops working it helps if you copy something in a win32 program and
      THEN go back to MindTerm to do the copy(?)
    o Bug in linux with blackdown jdk1.1.7v1a&v3, exit takes several seconds?
    o Bug in win32 with jdk1.2.2, confirm-dialog has buttons above message?!
    o Bug with "Select all", flaky/sloow
    o Bug with several jdk's on Linux, Caps Lock doesn't work(!)


=================
TODO NEXT:
    o SSH2 support (we're getting there... :-)
    o Shape up MindTunnel (make a package with a service for winDOS)
    o Shape up MindVNC (especially use new SSHPropertyHandler and it should be
      more usable)
    o Have aliases in the jar-file (i.e. several "standard" settings included in
      the jar.
    o Disconnected usage, i.e. wait for connect on tunnel then reconnect to sshd
      (timeouts etc.)
    o Make-procedure better, it's non-existent right now :-)
    o Check standard java signing (for java-plugin)
    o Build httpd into MindTunnel for setup (and serving MindTerm-applet :-)
    o Option to detach the applet so that the browser can change page, how is
      this done??
    o Make line-draw characters real images to improve performance (quite ugly
      now... :-)
    o Better key-mapping support (we want something like xmodmap)
    o Check all terminal modes to work correctly, chech against 'terminfo'
      entries
    o Clean up logs
    o Some more error-handling and general clean-up
    o Rewrite (mostly GUI-parts) in java2 (i.e. use swing)
    o Example code on usage of terminal-package by itself
    o Example code on usage of ssh-package's drop-in socket-replacements
    o Code-documentation + online javadoc
    o Other fun stuff...


=================
TODO SOMETIME:
    o Easy to install stand-alone packages for win32, mac, epoc32, linux
    o MindTunnel/MindTerm, could do some funny extensions if used together...
    o Do customized "small-screen" version for Psion5mx
    o Telnet support
    o Check if we can extend Dialog to do a decent handling of requestFocus
    o Statistics per tunnel shown in 'Current Connections...' dialog
    o Make a simple script-engine to be able to do fun things upon login
      (SSHAutomatedConsole)
    o Write better doc's for both install and usage
    o Load applet-properties, known_hosts through URLs (encrypted files, or use
      HTTPS?)
    o Persistent applet in Netscape and IE4
    o Make jump-scroll/non-jump-scroll (right now we do longjmp-scroll :-)
    o Application keypad not supported
    o Priority/mtu on a per tunnel basis (i.e. make some tunnels "more
      responsive" than others)
    o Make a RMI-plugin (RMI over SSH :-)
    o Fix the sloppy exceptions (e.g. make a new exception-type...)
    o Scaling font in terminal instead of changing rows/cols when resizing
      terminal
    o Extend Component instead of Canvas in TerminalWin
    o Implement X-protocol to allow (simple?) x-clients to run directly (without
      x-server! :-)
    o Support rlogin
    o Make the protocol-plugins more usable (clean/effective), maybe add some
      other proxy-service? (suggestions welcome!)
    o Compression (can't get deflate/inflate to use Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, feature
      request sent to javasoft). Might wrap the native code ourselves...
    o Double width and double height characters in terminal (is this useful?
      xterm doesn't do it for real anyway :-)
    o resourceBundle.getString for translations of all text!
